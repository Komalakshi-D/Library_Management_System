# Library Management System
## Overview:
The Library Management System's data analysis leverages Python and its libraries to extract insights. Utilizing Pandas and mysql-connector-python, it extracts, manipulates, and visualizes data from tables like Authors, Publishers, and Reviews. Matplotlib aids in generating visualizations, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of book distribution, member activity, and review trends.
## Purpose:

## Database Schema:
**The database consists of the following tables:**

**1. Authors:** Stores author details including their ID, first name, last name, birthdate, and nationality. 
**2. Publishers:** Manages publisher information such as ID, name, address, phone, and email.
**3. Categories:** Organizes book categories with a unique ID, category name, description, parent category ID, and creation date.
 **4. Books:** Tracks book details including ID, title, author ID, publisher ID, category ID, and price.
 **5. Members:** Stores member information including ID, first name, last name, membership date, email, and phone number.
 **6. Loans:** Records loan transactions with loan ID, book ID, member ID, loan date, return date, and due date.
 **7. Reviews:** Manages book reviews with review ID, book ID, member ID, rating, review text, and review date.

## Conclusion:
**1. Book Borrowing Trends:** Through the analysis of loan data, we can understand borrowing patterns, including the popularity of different book categories and the frequency of book borrowing over time.
**2. Book Ratings and Reviews:** Integrating book ratings and reviews allows for the identification of highly-rated books, which can be valuable for recommending popular titles to library users.
**3. Author and Category Analysis:** The system enables analysis of book distribution by author and category, shedding light on the diversity of the library's collection and the preferences of its users.
**4. Cost Analysis:** By considering book prices alongside borrowing trends, the system can assist in cost analysis and budgeting for book acquisitions.
**5. Visualization and Reporting:** Through data visualization techniques such as bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts, the system presents data in an easily understandable format, aiding decision-making processes and facilitating communication of key insights.
